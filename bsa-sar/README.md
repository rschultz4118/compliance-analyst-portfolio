# üìä BSA / SAR Compliance Test Script **Template**

This project contains a **template workbook** that demonstrates how a compliance test script can be structured for the **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** and **Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)**. It illustrates how compliance testing may be documented in **audit-ready workpapers**, using a framework approach.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a **template for demonstration purposes only**. It does not include client data or completed testing.

## üõ† Skills Demonstrated
- BSA/AML regulatory knowledge.  
- Compliance monitoring and testing methodology.  
- Documentation of testing execution and results.

## üöÄ How to Use (Template Workflow)
1. Open `BSA_SAR_Test_Script_Workbook.xlsx`.  
2. In **Sample Selection**, log sample transactions or customer IDs.  
3. Add evidence in **Document Repository** with unique Document IDs.  
4. The **Supporting Documentation** column in Sample Selection will auto-populate via XLOOKUP.  
5. Complete testing in **Test Script** by answering each compliance question and documenting execution steps.  
6. Track findings and remediation in the **Findings & Remediation** tab.
